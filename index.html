              How One Scientist-Turned-Founder Is Bridging Drug Discovery With
              Blockchain

              <p>
                After years working in labs studying the cell cycle and the
                genetics of human disease, Gennaro D'Urso founded Genetic
                Networks, a for-profit company focused on drug discovery. As a
                teenager, D'Urso lost vision in both of his eyes due to a
                genetic eye condition. He later received a corneal transplant,
                which allowed him to regain 20/20 vision in one of his eyes.
                This event led him to switch majors from business to science,
                and he eventually received his Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics.
                <br /><br />
                During his years of research, he focused on understanding how
                genes and proteins work together and how they can be identified
                and cataloged. While many drug companies look at gene targets
                that have the potential to be effective, he believes that the
                way drugs are currently tested is often unsustainable and
                inefficient due to the failure rates and associated research
                costs.

              <p>
                Bún Bò Huế is a spicy Vietnamese noodle soup that is absolutely
                addictive and one of the best noodle soups in the world. Unlike
                the ubiquitous, well-loved and well-known pho, bun bo hue is
                strangely not as popular. But those in the know, know: Bun bo
                hue is where it's at.
                <br /><br />
                Any good cook will tell you that homemade soups are a labour of
                love. They take time and a little bit of effort, but like any
                thing that is worth waiting for, they are absolutely
                heartwarming. Soups, especially noodle soups, are my go to bowl
                of comfort. I love the flavors and combination of textures, the
                slurping, the messiness, the fun, the satisfaction. And if you
                had to ask me what my all time favorite noodle soup was, I would
                probably say: bun bo hue.

                  victories in the first of this weekend's two races at Fuji
                  where Corvette and Callaway Competition also made a little bit
                  of history.

              rules

                AlphaTauri driver Yuki Tsunoda and Aston Martin driver Lance
                Stroll were pulled up for pitlane speeding to various degrees
                during the disrupted practice session, with each team receiving
                a fine from the FIA for their transgressions.
                <br /><br />
                FP2 ran 30 minutes longer than usual, thanks to CCTV issues and
                Pierre Gasly's stationary Alpine disrupting and ending FP1
                earlier in the day.
                <br /><br />
                The incident that led to Stroll's penalty occurred around
                4.40pm, as he drove at a speed of 97.8km/h in the pitlane
                17.8km/h over the mandatory speeding limit. The FIA concluded
                that Stroll made a breach of Article 34.7 of the FIA Formula 1
                Sporting Regulations, fining Aston Martin €1,000 for his
                mistake.
